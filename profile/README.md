# (Artemis-QUB) COLAV

Our research develops an autonomous marine navigation system that ensures safe, efficient operation in dynamic environments while maintaining real-time compliance with COLREGs. Our motion planner prioritizes provable safety, balancing simplicity with competitiveness. Unlike modern deep-learning "black box" methods, it remains interpretable yet more advanced than basic state machines methods, enabling effective handling of complex scenarios.
We are designing COLAV as a plug-and-play module for any vessel with proper integration. In collaboration with Artemis, experts in sustainable hydrofoil technology, we leverage hydro foiling's simpler dynamics to refine and validate our system in both simulations and real-world tests.
